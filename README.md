This is a practise exercise. 
The aim is to use the creation of a todo app to practise my knowledge and understanding of html, css and js but mostly javascript.
Already created a lot of files and made a couple additions before commmitng and pushing the code to GitHub, hence the lack of clarity in the first commit message but subsequent commit will have detailed explanations of changes made like the addition and creation of new features to the app.
